# BlendMimic3D-DataExtractor: Blender Data Extraction Tool

## Overview

The BlendMimic3D-DataExtractor is designed to convert .fbx files to .npy format, specifically for human motion analysis. It was instrumental in generating [BlendMimic3D](https://github.com/FilipaLino/BlendMimic3D) dataset from our project. For more detailed information about to our project please visit our [project webpage](https://blendmimic3d.github.io/BlendMimic3D/).

This repository contains scripts that require Blender to run.

Blender can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.blender.org/download/).

## Dependencies
- Blender
- Python

## Contents
- `3D_extraction.py`: Converts .fbx files to .npz files containing 3D joint data. 
- `camParams.py`: Extracts camera parameters used in the animations.
- `2D_extraction.py`: Extracts 2D joint data by projecting the 3D joint data onto 2D space using camera parameters.
- `occlusion.py`: Determines the presence of occlusions in the dataset.
- `fbx2jason/`: Intended for storing .fbx files converted to JSON.
- `regular/`: Default directory for placing sample .fbx files.

## Setup
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Blender is installed and added to your system PATH.

## Usage Instructions

### General Usage
Before running the scripts, download a sample .fbx file from your Blender animation ([link](https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/export-animations-from-blender-to-unreal-engine)) and place it into the `regular` folder.

### 3D Data Extraction
1. Move the .fbx file to the `regular` folder.
2. Open a command prompt with administrator permissions.
3. Change to the directory containing `3D_extraction.py`.
4. Execute the script with the following command:
   ```
   blender --background -P 3D_extraction.py -- --joint-id 8 --armature-name Armature --subject S1
   ```

### Camera Parameters Extraction
1. Change to the directory containing `camParams.py`.
2. Execute the script with the following command:
   ```
   blender --background animation.blend --python camParams.py -- S1
   ```

### 2D Data Conversion
1. Change to the directory containing `2D_extraction.py`.
2. Execute the script with the following command:
   ```
   blender --background animation.blend --python 2D_extraction.py -- S1 action_name
   ```

### Occlusion Handling
1. Change to the directory containing `occlusion.py`.
2. Execute the script with the following command:
   ```
   blender --background animation.blend --python occlusion.py -- --joint-id 8 --armature-name Armature --subject S1
   ```
